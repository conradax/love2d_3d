## What is this
This is an experiment to draw 3d model in [love2d](https://love2d.org/).

It's simulates pixel using `love.graphics.rectangle()`.

It's draws every pixel with `depth testing` and the color returned by a function in `fragShader.lua`,

Therefore, it has bad performance.

## Why
Just for fun. I was learning computer graphics, and decided to make this.
